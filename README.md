# Space Engineers Programmable Block Scripts

This is some scripts I've written for the programmable blocks in the game Space Engineers, which interact with the game in various ways.

Information about each script can be found in a comment at the top of each script file. Scripts are written in C#, using the games interfaces and apis.
